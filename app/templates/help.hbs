    <h2>Getting Help</h2>
  </header>
  <hr>
  <p>ember-cordova is still under active development, and we encourage you
  reaching out with bugs and confusing points. There are two main support
  avenues:</p>

  <h3>Github Issues (<a class="wrapper" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/isleofcode/ember-cordova/issues">link</a>)</h3>

  <p>Please use issues to report bugs, edge cases and faulty implementations / documentation.</p>
  <h3>Slack</h3>
  <p>There is an #e-cordova channel on the <a class="wrapper" target="_blank" href="https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com">ember-slack</a>, which is more geared towards how-to &amp; implementation questions.</p>
